### [Write your first Flutter app on the web](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab-web)

This is a guide to creating your first Flutter web app. If you are familiar with object-oriented programming, and concepts such as variables, loops, and conditionals, you can complete this tutorial. You don’t need previous experience with Dart, mobile, or web programming.

#### What you’ll build

You’ll implement a simple web app that displays a sign in screen. The screen contains three text fields: first name, last name, and username. As the user fills out the fields, a progress bar animates along the top of the sign in area. When all three fields are filled in, the progress bar displays in green along the full width of the sign in area, and the Sign up button becomes enabled. Clicking the Sign up button causes a welcome screen to animate in from the bottom of the screen.
